# My First HTML project ðŸ¤“

This is an initial practice project aiming to present the basic aspects of an HTML structure.
The goal is to show with clarity the most commonly used elements and attributes for an HTML webpage, hoping that new enthusiasts can get familiar with it. All files contain notes explaining basic strutures, attributes and elements used in an HTML file.
